# Airbnb House Price Prediction (Regression Task)

Task provided in the "ReGereration Big Data & AI 2021 powered by Microsoft Azure" academy in Greece.

This project was made to feature hands on practice in the principles of the model deployment process, which include:

1. Functional Programming
2. Script Segmentation (Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Model Testing)
3. Model Deployment with a REST-API implementation into a Dockerfile image.


======  Files:

EDA.ipynb : Data exploration & visualisation process.


requirements.txt : Python packages used withinin the project

====== scripts:

preprocessing.py : feature engineering and preprocessing of the initial dataframe by using pandas
train_model.py : train several models under the cleaned dataframe and report their metrics.

server.py: creates a REST API server with several endpoints for the sake of providing regression predictions.


The preprocessed data was also used on MS-Azure cloud environment.
