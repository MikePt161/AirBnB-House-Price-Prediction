# Airbnb House Price Prediction (Regression Task)

This project was made to mainly practice the principles of the model deployment process, which include:

1. Functional Programming
2. Script Segmentation (Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Model Testing)
3. Model Deployment with a REST-API implementation into a Dockerfile image.


A data exploration & visualisation process is also implemented on the EDA jupyter notebook file.

The preprocessed data was also used on MS-Azure cloud environment.
